# Macros

## Basic macro management

- `q{a-z}`: Start recording a macro
- `q`: Stop recording a macro
- `{count}@{a-z}`: Play a macro
- `@@`: Play the last executed macro

## Notes

- Macros are recorded in lowercase registers (a-z). Uppercase registers (A-Z) append to the corresponding lowercase register.
- Macros can include any sequence of commands, including movements, edits, and even other macros.
- Use macros to automate repetitive tasks and improve efficiency.
- Register commands can be used to update macros which are stored in the registers.
